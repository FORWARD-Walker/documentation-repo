\subsection{Ranging Algorithms}
\noindent Instructing FORWARD where to guide the user is a solution that the detection and identification systems generate. Various scenarios are described in the system testing chapter. It will be a matter of solving an adaptive geometrical situation and relaying the results to the processor.\\

\subsubsection{Time-of-Flight Calculation}
\noindent The equation to calculate range from time-of-flight is mentioned first in \ref{sssec:tof}. We note that, the speed of sound and of light greatly exceed the latency requirement in order to guide the rollator. We can observe in nearly real time changes in the range readings. As we see, we can use the Arduino's IDE serial plotter to visualize these telemetry readings.\\

\subsubsection{Range Reading Harmonization}
\noindent In order to properly utilize all of the data our peripherals supply, we must design an effective and efficient sensor fusion system that can harmonize all of the incoming sensor data with the object detection data. In our research, we referenced an article \cite{CVRef2} that discussed using a 2D grid to determine where objects were in space. We are going to bring these ideas into our design, but allowing the object data, which comes with a position on a 2D-grid, to set this grid, which then our sensors can be associated to certain sections of this grid to provide ranging. For our purposes, x = 1920 and y = 1080 because our camera has a 1920x1080 frame size. We also know that the origin (0,0) is at the bottom left from the perspective of the camera. In figure \ref{fig:proposedsensorFOV}, we see that we will have four sonar sensors surrounding FORWARD. To illustrate my point, if we had an object return the position (1200, 1800, 0, 800), this being the form (Xmin, Xmax, Ymin, Ymax), then we would trigger the front right sonar sensor and receive the ranging measurement of said object. \\

\noindent We will also utilize the LiDAR readings to provide more precise ranging... \\

\noindent There are more outputs the inertial measurement unit can provide besides the angles. One of most interesting ones is the accelerations. This would be the rate that the velocity of the rollator body is changing with respect to time. 

\noindent This is also where an estimator is useful.\\

\subsubsection{I2C Bus for Sensors}
\noindent The utilization of four ultrasonic sensors and one LiDAR to supply a feed of information to FORWARD's central processor can be integrated and realized through a wiring bus with the I2C digital communication protocol. This I2C scheme will use a synchronous clock signal provided to the sensors by the MCU. It will operate always in half-duplex, meaning data will be transmitted in only one direction at a time - from the MCU to the sensors and from the sensors back to the MCU in successive time steps. Additionally, the sensors will be accessed by their unique addresses and send packets of information as a sequence, taking turns.\\
