\subsection{Ranging Algorithms}
\noindent Instructing FORWARD where to guide the user is a solution that the detection and identification systems generate. Various scenarios are described in the system testing chapter. It will be a matter of solving an adaptive geometrical situation and relaying the results to the processor.\\

\subsubsection{Time-of-Flight Calculation}
\noindent The equation to calculate range from time-of-flight is mentioned first in \ref{sssec:tof}\\

\subsubsection{Range Reading Harmonization}
\noindent This is where an estimator is useful.\\
