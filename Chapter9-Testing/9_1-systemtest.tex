\subsection{Prototype System Testing}

\noindent FOV directivity test for range sensors, depression angle test, incoming data stream test.\\

% object detection test - range updates continuously and raises flag or interrupt if crosses below a threshold of danger
% - passing obstacle (confirm margin of safety)
% - moving obstacle

% object identification test - classify obstacles and send walker into a moded resposne

% object avoidance test - activate feedback and update motor speeds

% in SD2, will need to refine turning ratios, hazard range thresholds, and work on stretch requirements.
