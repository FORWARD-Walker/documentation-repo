\subsection{Subsystem Testing}
% talks about different rigorous methods of testing the system

%\noindent FOV directivity test for range sensors, depression angle test, incoming data stream test.\\
% raise alerts if range threshold is crossed
% object detection test - range updates continuously and raises flag or interrupt if crosses below a threshold of danger
% - passing obstacle (confirm margin of safety)
% - moving obstacle
\subsubsection{Detection Threshold}


% object identification test - classify obstacles and send walker into a moded resposne
% relay audio feedback to user informing them what is ahead
\subsubsection{Identification Importance}


% object avoidance test - activate feedback and update motor speeds
\subsubsection{Emergency Stop}


% in SD2, will need to refine turning ratios, hazard range thresholds, and work on stretch requirements.
