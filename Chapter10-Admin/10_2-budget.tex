\subsection{Project Budget}
\noindent The table above shows the tentative budget for FORWARD. We have yet to select specific models for the components. As we continue to research and develop, there will likely be changes made to this table. The project will require a pre-built walker as well as 5 peripheral components, 2 motors, and 2 controllers, as well as wiring and PCB housing. \\
