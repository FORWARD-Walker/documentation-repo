\subsection{Project Milestones}
\noindent The figure below shows various project milestones with their estimated start and end dates. The duration is given in days. There is also a Gantt chart generated by this data. The paper should be incrementally completed throughout the first semester, progressing towards a subsystem demo before an official full system prototype is made on a breadboard. After that is done, the printed circuit board will be ordered and the entirety of the second semester will be dedicated to integration and final testing and assembly. \\
