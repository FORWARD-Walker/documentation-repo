\newline \noindent The following is by far, not necessarily a finished list of design impacts that the technologies have on FORWARD development. As the design process continues, this may be revised for the final documentation.\\

% the impact the standards and constraints (technologies actually) have on FORWARD development and design
\noindent \underline{\textit{Design Impact of I2C}}
I2C is great for buses of sensors, especially as the number involved grows. FORWARD utilizes four ultrasonics, one LiDAR, and one camera, and so this technology can greatly increase the ease of design implementation.\\

UART\\
	
\noindent \underline{\textit{Design Impact of Bluetooth}}
Bluetooth\\

\noindent \underline{\textit{Design Impact of Wifi}}
Wifi wireless network\\

\noindent \underline{\textit{Design Impact of GPIO}}
GPIO and Serial\\

\noindent \underline{\textit{Design Impact of Connections}}
The sensors can also be\\

\noindent \underline{\textit{Design Impact of Embedded Software}}
Embedded programming in the C language gives great low-level control over registers containing the FORWARD sensor readings as well as allowing the computer vision to interact with the feedback and velocity control by the motors. As noted in later sections however, Arduino is the preferred development tool.\\
