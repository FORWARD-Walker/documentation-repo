\noindent The following is by far, not necessarily a finished list of design impacts that the technologies have on FORWARD development. As the design process continues, this may be revised for the final documentation.\\

% the impact the standards and constraints (technologies actually) have on FORWARD development and design
\underline{\textit{Design Impact of I2C}}
I2C is great for buses of sensors, especially as the number involved grows. FORWARD utilizes 4 ultrasonic, 1 LiDAR, and 1 camera, and so this technology can greatly increase the ease of design implementation.\\

\underline{\textit{Design Impact of UART}}
	
	
\underline{\textit{Design Impact of Bluetooth}}


\underline{\textit{Design Impact of Wifi}}


\underline{\textit{Design Impact of Connections}}
The sensors can also be 

\underline{\textit{Design Impact of Embedded Software}}
Embedded programming in the C language gives great low-level control over registers containing the FORWARD sensor readings as well as allowing the computer vision to interact with the feedback and velocity control by the motors.\\
