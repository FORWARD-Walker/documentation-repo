\noindent Chapter 4 discusses the related standards and constraints for both hardware and software used by FORWARD during development and realization. The main consideration for standards is given to connections, medical rollators, and IEEE guidelines on Bluetooth, wireless networks, sensors, motors, and serial communications. In addition, we examine constraints through the lenses of economic, environmental, social, political, ethical, health, and safety.

\subsection{Related Standards}
\noindent FORWARD must comply with all IEEE-related standards relating to sensors, motors, computer vision, and image processing. Taking a brief look at the specifics, none are immediately seen as hindrances to the proceedings of FORWARDâ€™s research. Should an issue arise with IEEE-related standards later in the project, future documentation will indicate that. \\

\noindent The ADA (American Disabilities Act) also has stipulations for environments to make accommodations for these assistive vehicles including walkers and electric wheelchairs. However, none of these should affect our design process, given that our product is safe to operate around other people and in busy environments.

\subsubsection{Connection Standards}
\noindent USB Type C is notably used to connect the ESP32 Camera module to the central processor. In addition, we utilized USB Type B to program the Arduino Uno for initial sensor interfacing. There are unique connectors for the DC brushless motors as well. The LiDAR sensor utilizes a 6-pin Japan Solderless Terminal (JST).
