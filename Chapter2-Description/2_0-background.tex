\subsection*{Project Background}
\noindent Walkers are a mobility aid commonly deployed in the environment of medical institutions such as hospitals and assisted living homes. They are also used daily by patients not just in the medical setting, but in neighborhoods, parks, shopping malls, and just about anywhere you can stroll. There is a sizeable market for these support tools. If you include other devices such as canes, the market valuation exceeds \$1 billion. There is a great need for these as the US elderly population continues to grow. Currently there are over 50 million people who are considered elderly, and some studies suggest that a quarter of these utilize walkers or canes. \\

\noindent The goal of this project is to use the latest of electrical and computer engineering technologies to develop a solution that vastly improves the functionality of walkers and to improve their user experience. We want to implement functionality that will be useful for both users with physical injury and users with sensory impairments. For instance, a blind person will greatly benefit from audio feedback that warns them of hazards or obstacles ahead. Additionally, a deaf person will be blessed by haptic feedback for the same purpose. In short, FORWARD helps to keep people safe independently of the userâ€™s own spatial awareness.
