\subsection{Project Block Diagram}

\indent The peripherals, depicted in the diagram by circles, are functionally sensors and feedback for user guidance. The microcontroller unit will receive and transmit data from the peripherals while also communicating with the motor controller to steer and drive. In turn, the position determination algorithm, coupled with the speed and steering control, comprise the object avoidance function. Additionally, the computer vision system will be able to recognize objects; it too contains a peripheral camera â€“ depicted by the blue circle below. Headlights are an optional feature configured to turn on in lowlight environments. Finally, an implicit element of the diagram are the power inputs from the battery supply. The work breakdown is shown in the key below. Tobiah, being a signal processing EE will be covering all of the sensor and signal subsystems, Morgan, being an EE interested in robotics and power will be covering all subsystems under those categories, and Matthew, being the only CpE will be focusing on much of the software, including the embedded programming and computer vision software and algorithms.
