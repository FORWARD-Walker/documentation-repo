\noindent Ranging sensors are used to provide range information for a plethora of products today. They are popularly found in robotics, where they are able to provide awareness of the surroundings, vehicles, where they enable autonomous navigation, or for smart facility and home solutions, where they can detect movement and be used to trigger various actions.\\

\noindent One of the constraints in FORWARD is to navigate without GPS.\\

\noindent In this project, we utilize ultrasonic sensing as 1) mono and multistatic, 2) active, and 3) .\\

\noindent We deploy LiDAR in the context of this project as 1) oriented laterally, 2) topographic, and 3) . Typically, LiDAR has a \\

\noindent We also use IMU technology for the purpose of obtaining the acceleration and body rate readings of the walker.\\

\noindent Sensor fusion is  \\
