\subsubsection{Sensor Ranging}
% Toby - sensors, haptics
\noindent Ranging sensors are used to provide range information for a plethora of products today. They are popularly found in robotics, where they are able to provide awareness of the surroundings, vehicles, where they enable autonomous navigation, or for smart facility and home solutions, where they detect movement and are used to trigger various actions. FORWARD requires sensors to enable safe navigation and it is thus appropriate to examine the technologies available to determine which to utilize.\\

\noindent \underline{\textit{Time-of-Flight}} sensors are not suitable for FORWARD because of their narrow field of vision.\\

\noindent \underline{\textit{Global Positioning System}} One of the constraints in FORWARD is to navigate without GPS.\\

\noindent In this project, we utilize ultrasonic sensing as 1) mono and multistatic, 2) active, and 3) .\\

\noindent We deploy LiDAR in the context of this project as 1) oriented laterally, 2) topographic, and 3) . Typically, LiDAR has a. ALso consider reflectivity and ambient lighting\\

\noindent We also use IMU technology for the purpose of obtaining the acceleration and body rate readings of the walker.\\

\noindent Sensor fusion is  \\
