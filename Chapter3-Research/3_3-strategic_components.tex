\noindent \underline{\textit{Sonar vs. LiDAR for Detection}} As gleaned from \cite{sonarvslidar}, ultrasonic sensors are advantageous for their low cost, simple digital input and output, and wider FOV. However, they lack in their exposure to environment, slower response time, and larger physical size. LiDAR sensors on the other hand, are small and lightweight, and have a fast response time. However, they generally cost more and have a more narrow FOV because of their environmental seal.\\
