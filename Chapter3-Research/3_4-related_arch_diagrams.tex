\subsubsection{Proposed Sensor FOV Topology}
\noindent A ranging apparatus comprised of four ultrasonic sensors, one central LiDAR sensor, and optionally, a camera with spatial AI, should provide ample ability to FORWARD's object detection feature. Two wide FOV ultrasonic sensors face forward: one on each walker leg. Two face sideways, also mounted on the bottom half of the legs. The LiDAR sensor is mounted centrally so its beam detects straight-on obstacles. The camera is also mounted centrally.\\

\subsubsection{Kalman Filter}
\noindent As part of the project stretch requirement, implementation of a typical sensor fusion algorithm will help to predict the walker's trajectory and provide counteractive insight to the guidance system.\\
