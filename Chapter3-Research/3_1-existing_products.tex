\noident By using YOLO 8, we can obtain free open source AI image classification models that we can configure to fit our own needs. The benefits of this solution for our image classification system include zero cost, configurability, and minimal memory footprint (a few hundred MB) - which are all important aspects for our desired solution. The negatives include the needed man hours to train and implement this model for our purposes and time to run (anywhere from 0.1 to 3 seconds). The time to predict could exclude this option from our options as we need to have classification under 1 second latency, ideally in the realm of a few hundred milliseconds.
